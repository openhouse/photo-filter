# ARTISTIC-NOTES.md

This document provides editorial and artistic context for the Photo Filter Application, referencing the ways photography, curation, and narrative come together in the project. It is intended to help future contributors understand the artistic motivations behind certain design decisions.

## Editorial and Narrative Approach

- **Intentional Sequences**  
  The application isn't merely a batch sorter of images; it helps create sequences that function almost like photo essays or mini-narratives. Each album can be ordered or filtered in ways that highlight a story arc—people present, aesthetic scores, or event chronology.

- **Contextual Metadata**  
  We emphasize user-driven annotation and curation. While the app draws on Apple Photos library data, the user’s personal “artistic sense” (e.g., references to an old 8mm camera or time-lapse sequences) shapes how they pick or weigh certain aesthetic scores.

- **User as Editor**  
  The user effectively serves as an editor, deciding which images to “export” or highlight. By showing multiple vantage points in quick succession, the short ‘micro animations’ described in our overall project vision come to life.

## Why This Matters for Contributors

1. **UI and UX**:  
   Understanding the user’s editorial desire to quickly form a “photo story” ensures that future UI enhancements (e.g., grouping selected shots, providing an instant storyboard preview) align with the underlying editorial flow.

2. **Documentation**:  
   Art-based language or code comments that reference “story arcs,” “montage,” or “narrative logic” might appear. These notes let contributors see why the code is structured around flexible sorting, filtering, and partial exports.

3. **Future Integrations**:
   - Potential tools for “story notes” or “annotations” on images.
   - Collaborative editing features where multiple users discuss or rank images to shape a final “photo essay.”

## Suggestions for Further Development

- **Story Mode**:  
  A future feature that packages a user’s curated images, along with textual annotations, into a shareable web gallery or mini digital zine.

- **Annotations UI**:  
  Possibly layering short text notes onto a “selected sequence” of images so that each “chapter” in a photo essay has a distinct thematic anchor.

- **Editorial Guidelines**:  
  Encouraging or guiding best practices for consistent imagery, color, or timing if the user wants a coherent final look.
