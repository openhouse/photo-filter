# RELATIONAL-PRACTICES.md

This document outlines the cultural and mindful norms for collaboration, both among humans and with AI or other automated systems. It builds on the themes in `COMPASSION.md` and provides more specific guidance for sustaining healthy relational dynamics within the Photo Filter Application’s community.

## Guiding Principles

1. **User Ownership of Memories**  
   Photos are intimate carriers of personal or communal memory. Any code that processes these images must treat that data with reverence and respect.

2. **Shared Authorship**  
   The open-source contributors, third-party developers, and AI assistants are co-authors of the evolving codebase. We collectively own design decisions and share responsibility for maintaining relational integrity.

3. **Transparent Communication**  
   All major architectural or feature changes should be proposed and documented clearly, with an invitation for feedback. This reduces confusion and fosters empathy.

4. **Mindful Interactions**
   - **AI Involvement**: Whenever generative AI or large language models assist in code or doc creation, we label it explicitly.
   - **Conflict Mediation**: If design disputes arise, a short reflection period is advised. We either pick the approach that best serves the relational context or schedule a synchronous conversation.

## Recommended Practices

- **Code Reviews**

  - Focus on the _why_ behind changes, not just the _what_.
  - Offer respectful suggestions, not abrupt demands.

- **Issue Discussions**

  - Frame problems neutrally, highlight potential solutions with compassion for others’ perspectives.
  - Mark uncertain aspects with “Uncertain” tags.

- **Documentation Updates**
  - Reference real user stories, actual emotional or relational contexts.
  - For instance, mention how a certain feature helps a user preserve memories of loved ones in a caring way.

## Integrations with `COMPASSION.md`

Where `COMPASSION.md` sets overarching ethical and mindful standards, `RELATIONAL-PRACTICES.md` is more tactical:

- Provides real examples, use-case scenarios, and protocols for collaboration.
- Recommends mediation processes or reflection sessions for major decisions.

---

## Looking Ahead

1. **Community Dialogues**:  
   Hosting open “town hall”–style Zoom calls or asynchronous Slack threads for user feedback on major features.

2. **Educational Materials**:  
   Possibly building short tutorials on “how to sort photos while respecting diverse emotional triggers” or “leading a healthy collaborative design session for new features.”

3. **Respectful Off-Ramps**:  
   If a collaborator or user wants to disengage from certain code responsibilities, we have a plan for handing off tasks so that no one feels undue pressure.
