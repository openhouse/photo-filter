# MINDFUL-DISCLAIMERS.md

## Purpose

This file centralizes all disclaimers and precautionary statements so that contributors, users, and stakeholders fully understand the relational and emotional considerations of working with photo-based data in the Photo Filter Application.

---

## 1. Emotional Sensitivity Disclaimer

**Context**  
Photography often contains memories with significant emotional resonance—family events, personal milestones, or reminders of loss. Filtering through large volumes of images may trigger unexpected memories or emotional responses.

**Disclaimer**  
While the Photo Filter Application aims to facilitate creative exploration, we acknowledge that certain imagery may evoke stress, sadness, or trauma. We encourage users and team members to practice self-care, take breaks, and seek supportive resources if distress arises.

## 2. Trauma-Informed User Interactions

**Context**  
Trauma-informed design helps us avoid re-traumatizing users inadvertently. The app occasionally surfaces old photos or personal moments that may intersect with difficult past experiences.

**Disclaimer**  
This software does not replace professional mental health support. If reviewing or sorting photos triggers severe emotional distress, please reach out to a qualified professional or mental health resource. The development team has integrated mindful language and gentle UI prompts, but we cannot predict or prevent all triggers.

## 3. Privacy and Data Sensitivity

**Context**  
The Photo Filter Application processes metadata from a user’s personal photo library. This metadata can include date/time, location, and face recognition data, all of which is sensitive.

**Disclaimer**  
Users are responsible for ensuring they comply with relevant privacy regulations and best practices. The code, as provided, does not collect or store your images on third-party servers beyond your local environment—unless explicitly connected to an external service by you. If you deploy the application in a shared or cloud environment, you must configure secure access controls.

## 4. Ethical Use of Visual AI

**Context**  
The platform can support or integrate with AI-based analytics (face detection, aesthetic scoring, etc.).

**Disclaimer**  
We caution contributors and end-users to assess whether these AI features align with their ethical standards. We assume no liability for misuse of AI-driven capabilities. Always audit your data processing flows for potential bias or discriminatory outcomes.

## 5. Developers’ Emotional Wellbeing

**Context**  
Much like users, developers can feel overwhelmed if managing intense or large-scale photo sets or dealing with emotional user stories. This is especially true when debugging or manually verifying large emotional archives.

**Disclaimer**  
We encourage all contributors to adopt healthy boundaries—take breaks, practice mindfulness, and communicate openly with the team if tasks feel personally distressing. We have formal guidelines in [COMPASSION.md](./COMPASSION.md) and [RELATIONAL-PRACTICES.md](./RELATIONAL-PRACTICES.md).

## 6. Iteration and Evolution

We intend these disclaimers to be living elements of the project. If new disclaimers become relevant, please add them here. We welcome feedback, suggestions, or expansions as the app evolves.
