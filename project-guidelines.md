# Project Guidelines

## Project Philosophy

- **User-Centric Design**: Develop features that meet the specific needs of photographers working with large photo libraries.
- **Clarity and Readability**: Code should be easy to read and understand by humans and AI alike.
- **Modularity**: Break down the application into small, manageable modules.
- **Consistency**: Follow established conventions throughout the project.
- **Privacy and Security**: Handle sensitive user data responsibly, ensuring personal data remains private.
- **Performance**: Optimize for handling large datasets efficiently.
- **Scalability**: Design the application architecture to accommodate future growth and additional features.

## Coding Standards

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces).
- Follow naming conventions:
  - **Variables and Functions**: `camelCase`
  - **Classes and Constructors**: `PascalCase`
  - **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Write comments for complex code blocks.
- Avoid global variables; use modules and closures.
- Use ES6+ features where appropriate.

## Naming Conventions

- Use **dasherized** filenames for files (e.g., `photo-controller.js`).
- Directories and files should be **lowercase** with **hyphens**.
- Keep filenames descriptive and concise.

## Directory Structure

- **config/**: Configuration files.
- **controllers/**: Application logic and request handlers.
- **models/**: Database models and data structures.
- **routes/**: Route definitions and middleware.
- **views/**: Template files (Handlebars templates).
- **public/**: Static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images).
  - **stylesheets/**: CSS and SCSS files.
  - **images/**: Image files served to the client.
- **data/**: Data files and temporary caches (excluded from git).
- **exports/**: Symlinked export directories (excluded from git).
- **scripts/**: Utility scripts (e.g., `generate-overview.sh`).
- **tests/**: Automated tests.

## Documentation Practices

- Update `README.md` with project information, setup instructions, and usage examples.
- Use `generate-overview.sh` to generate project overviews automatically.
- **Include All Relevant Files**: Ensure that the project overview includes the contents of all relevant files, excluding personal data and photos.
- Include inline documentation in code files using JSDoc comments where appropriate.
- Maintain a changelog (`CHANGELOG.md`) to track changes over time.
- Document any architectural decisions in an `ARCHITECTURE.md` file.

## Privacy and Data Handling

- **Data Exclusion**: Do not include personal data or photos in the git repository.
- **Local Storage**: Store temporary caches and exported data securely on the user's local machine.
- **User Consent**: Ensure any data processing is transparent to the user.

## Project State and Continuity

- **Portability**: Ensure the project's state is fully contained within the project files for new collaborators or assistants.
- **Agile State Documentation**: Include the current project state, pending tasks, and future plans within the project files.
- **Self-Containment**: The project should be self-contained, requiring no external context to understand its current state and next steps.

## Collaboration Guidelines

- **Communication**:

  - Provide clear and concise messages when collaborating.
  - Use full file contents for any file to be modified or created to ensure verifiability.
  - Include all necessary information in the project overview for effective collaboration.

- **Code Provisioning**:

  - **Full File Replacements**: Always provide full files for any code changes to facilitate copy-paste replacement.
  - **Project Organization**: Organize the project into smaller, manageable files to support this method.

- **Version Control**:

  - Commit small, logical changes with clear commit messages.
  - Use branches for new features or bug fixes.

- **Code Review**:

  - Review and test contributions thoroughly before merging.
  - Encourage collaborative problem-solving.

- **Issue Tracking**:

  - Use issue tracking to manage tasks and bugs.

- **Best Practices**:

  - Keep the project composed of many small files to facilitate full file replacement via copy-paste from collaboration outputs.

## Environment and Dependency Management

- Use `.nvmrc` to specify Node.js versions.
- Keep dependencies up to date; use `yarn` consistently.
- Exclude unnecessary files and directories using `.gitignore` (e.g., `node_modules/`, `public/images/`, `data/`, `exports/`).
- **Integrate External Tools**: Manage calls to external tools (like `osxphotos`) within the Node.js application.

## Error Handling and Logging

- Implement robust error handling in all asynchronous code.
- Provide meaningful error messages.
- Use logging to aid in debugging and monitoring application health.

## Security Best Practices

- Do not commit sensitive information to version control.
- Use environment variables for configuration where necessary.
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

## Testing

- Write unit tests for critical components.
- Use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.
- Automate tests using scripts (e.g., `yarn test`).

## Deployment and Operations

- Document deployment processes.
- Use environment-specific configurations.
- Monitor application performance and errors in production environments.

## Performance Optimization

- Optimize code for performance when handling large datasets.
- Use caching strategies where appropriate.
- Profile and monitor resource usage.

**Note:** These guidelines should be reviewed and updated regularly as the project evolves.
